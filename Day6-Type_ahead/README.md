Things i learned:
=================
	* learned about RegExp constructors in JS and tried regular expressions for the first time in JS, earlier i learned the concepts of regex with python.
	
	* refreshed my earlier learnings about promises in JS, earlier i used axios it was first time with fetch. Now i prefer fetch over axios.
